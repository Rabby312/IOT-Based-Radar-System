# IOT-Based-Radar-System
Radar is an object detection system that uses electromagnetic waves to identify range, altitude, direction, or speed of both moving and fixed objects.
We make simple radar using the ultrasonic sensor. The movement of the sensor in controlled by using a small servo motor.

<P>If the radar find object properly it will show that object on the computer sceen and also light is automatically on at that moment. The system provide the sound also. If the radar can't find any object it will continuoslly find that object.</p>
